An infinite world of chaos mixed with sparks of wonder.

In order to do anything in the web, you must speak **Hyper Text Markup Language**, **HTML** for short. It lets you tell the computer how to build _static websites_.

Just a regular website with text and images. You can call it read-only page, because it can be read, but it can't be interacted with.
